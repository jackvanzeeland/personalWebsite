            The automation is triggered when a new email with a bank statement arrives. The process can be
            broken down into the following steps:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-group list-group-flush">
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>1. Email Monitoring:</strong> The UiPath robot continuously
                monitors the inbox for emails containing bank statements.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>2. Statement Download:</strong> When a relevant email is
                detected, the robot downloads the attached bank statement (PDF).</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>3. Data Extraction:</strong> The robot reads the PDF
                statement and extracts each transaction, including the date, description, and amount.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>4. Excel Integration:</strong> The extracted data is then
                written to a centralized Excel file, creating a unified record of all transactions.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>5. Manual Analysis:</strong> With all transactions in one
                place, I can easily perform manual data analysis on my spending habits.</li>
